Input a is bool
Input b is bool
Input c is bool

req1: Globally, it is always the case that if "c" holds, then "a" holds after at most "50" time units
req2: Globally, it is always the case that if "c" holds, then "b" holds after at most "50" time units
req3: Globally, it is never the case that "a" holds.

// Requirements req2, req1 are rt-inconsistent
// We found a FailurePath: 
// INITIAL     a=* b=* c=*
// [0;50]      a=false b=true c=true

// actual rt-inconsistency should be just req1
